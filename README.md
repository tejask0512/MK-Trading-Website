# Algo Trading and Financial News Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project combines algorithmic trading strategies with sentiment analysis of financial news to create a comprehensive trading system. By analyzing market data alongside news sentiment, the system aims to make more informed trading decisions based on both technical indicators and public market sentiment.

## Features
- **Algorithmic Trading Strategies**: Implementation of various technical trading algorithms
- **Financial News Sentiment Analysis**: NLP-based sentiment extraction from financial news sources
- **Combined Signal Generation**: Integration of technical indicators with sentiment signals
- **Backtesting Framework**: Tools to evaluate strategy performance using historical data
- **Real-time Trading API Integration**: Connectivity with trading platforms for execution

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- NLTK & spaCy for NLP and sentiment analysis
- scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Interactive Brokers/Alpaca API for trading execution
- Technical Analysis libraries for indicators

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tejask0512/Algo-trading-and-Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Algo-trading-and-Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```python
# Example code for running the sentiment analysis
from sentiment_analyzer import NewsSentimentAnalyzer

analyzer = NewsSentimentAnalyzer()
sentiment_score = analyzer.analyze_news("path/to/news/data")

# Example code for executing a trading strategy
from trading_strategies import MACrossover

strategy = MACrossover(fast_period=5, slow_period=20)
signals = strategy.generate_signals(price_data)
```
